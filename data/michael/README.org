[[./lightning.png]]

** bigquery-lightning.py
Pulls records detailing all lightning strikes within North America for the year of 2018. This data is recorded for each day of 2018 and is partially binned into 1km^2 regions.

This data is provided by NOAA.

** process_data.py
Assembles lightning strike data collected using the script =bigquery-lightning.py= then combines/bins the results by county. The script uses the center of the 1km^2 region described in the raw data to determine which county the total strikes occurred within/near. This is done by determining whether or not the center occurs within the bounding polygon of some county.
